basic idea:

tower defense

divine favour
   must sacrifice to various gods to make them like you more
   e.g sacrifice to war god and the enemies get weaker, harvest god and you get more food

however, sacrifices of food (which is running low anyway) will cause your people to starve
sacrifices of people can be done, but will reduce your population and make your people less happy

once happiness becomes 0, your people give up and you lose

once population becomes 0, you lose
